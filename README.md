### Project: Message Coder/Decoder
### By: Jordan Wilson

# About:

This project was designed to show how one can encrypt and decrypt passwords with an associated key.
Users are given the opportunity to create a private message and send it to other users
but they can only view the message with the key associated with the message. This
project emphasizes security along with sending other users private messages that they
would not want anyone else to see. Feel free to check out the repo. Thanks!


## How to run:

Simply clone the repo to your local machine and make sure you have python installed. After
you have those installed you can navigate to the folder with the file and run it. From
here you can run the encoder program. Once you do so, you can simply type in a message and
have the program encrypt it for you. Once you have your encrypted message you can run
the decoder program and type in your encrypted message. After that it will ask you for your
unlock key. Once you insert your key, you should see your message decrypted.
